Exponential Scheduler 

Advantages

i) Implementation is fairly simpler and as it is based on randomization, the processes are not scheduled in the same order every time.

ii) The ratio of how the processes can be manipulated by changing the values of lambda. The processes close to value of lambda are scheduled in higher ratio. 

iii) The scheduler when employed solves the problem of starvation where lower priority processes have to wait till the higher priority ones are processed.    

Disadvantages

i) It does not ensure fairness in scheduling. As it's a random scheduler, some processes might have to wait for a longer time to get scheduled. 

ii) Lambda value has to be chosen properly as extreme values might result in unfair scheduling.

Linux Scheduler

Advantages 

i) Ensures fairness among processes. This is done by allocating dynamic priority (goodness) based on the process priority and as well as the time it has run before.

ii) No randomization and gurantees that all processes are run.

Disadvantges

i) It's an intensive algorithm where the overhead of calculation for scheduling is high. Therefore the scheduling time is more.

3. Round Robin Scheduler of Xinu

Advantages 

i) The scheduler is fast as there is less overhead for scheduling.
ii) When there are multiple processes with equal priority they are scheduled one after the other in equal time.

Disadvantages

i) It results in starvation of lower priority processes.

Describe the way each of the schedulers affects the NULL process.

Exponential Scheduler

NULL processes are scheduled only if there are no other processes in ready state to be scheduled.

Linux Scheduler

The NULL process are handled in a way that they are scheduled only if there are no processes in ready state to be scheduled.

Xinu Round Robin Scheduler

We can see that the Xinu Default Scheduler always picks the last process, to schedule. Therefore if there are no processes is ready state, then the NULL process will be scheduled.
